# Module 7 Welcome Pack

Welcome to Module 7! This repo is meant to hold some convenient links for you to use during your capstone projects but this should not be treated as the canonical source of truth for curriculum, requirements etc.

Note: This is a living document. Things will be continuously changed and updated as needed but capstone requirements WILL NOT change! : )

```txt
‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT NOTE: If you are checking this out before your first capstone week officially begins please make sure you are keeping your pre-capstone project your top priority. All of this should be considered secondary until that project is done.
```

## Module Calendar

<!-- This calendar is your primary resource for knowing what you should be working on at any given time and when your deadlines are. Refer to it every day and check it before asking for clarification whenever possible.  -->

# Phase 1 - Project Approval

## Capstone Project Proposals

You must submit this form and get approval from your the Mod 7 team before starting any work on your capstone project. Any work you do while waiting for approval may have to be completely re-done based on TA feedback. With all that said, ***don't over-complicate your capstone***, this is a 2 week project and the stakes are high!

```txt
‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT NOTE: If you are checking this out before your first capstone week officially begins you are welcome to fill out this form but you will have to fill it out again on Monday / Tuesday officially.
```

[Project Proposal Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdiKzbJwaGmhAo8Rt63ev1GRnVhQwVcbwmMWLIWh0EHTEpyJA/viewform?usp=sf_link)

<!-- Choose a project that you feel confident that you could build in half the time you're being given. This is the professional move for an engineer under a tight inflexible deadline.
 -->
<!-- With all that said don't forget to pick something fun if you can. Regardless we're excited to see what you all pick so we can get you approved! -->

## Projects with Strong Success Rates

Here are some capstone project ideas that tend to be associated with success in the observations of the TAs, but of course they are not a garuantee of success. Please note ***these are in no particular order*** and you are absolutely ***not required to choose one of these*** projects. This list may guide your thought process as much or as little as you feel is appropriate.

### Projects that can look fantastic without AWS:
* Trello
* Quora
* Todoist (Remember the Milk but with a more modern UI)
* Reddit
* Evernote
* Eventbrite (or StubHub, TicketMaster etc)
* Amazon
* Zenni
* West Elm
* Kayak (or Orbit etc)
* Air BnB 
* New York Times Recipes
* Yelp
* Venmo

### Project that we strongly suggest have AWS:
* Pinterest
* Flikr
* FaceBook
* Bumble (or Hinge, FarmersOnly)
* Instagram
* GoFundMe (or Patreon etc)


## Projects We've Seen Students Struggle With:

Also for whatever it's worth here is a short list of projects that we see students struggle with regularly for a variety of reasons. You can absolutely choose one of these projects, just don't take them lightly.

* Discord 
* Soundcloud
* Spotify
* Robinhood
* YouTube
* Netflix
* Game Apps (LiPoker / LiChess / D&D themed / Magic themed etc)

## Appropriate Project Themes

When picking your capstone project theme use common sense and think about it from the perspective of a recruiter and your future job coach. Our goal is not to censor your creativity or discourage you but we do have an official policy on appropriate project themes linked below and we encourage you all to check it out. Recently the most common issues are with projects related to weed / cannabis. We can't approve projects related to these themes because of federal legality, but that doesn't mean you can't pursue these projects after capstones.

* [Project Theme Expectations](https://github.com/tombetthauser/module-7-welcome/blob/main/Project%20Theme%20Expectations%20-%20Student%20Facing%20Discussion.pdf)


<!-- ---

## Minimul Viable Product / Project

Remember, a minimum viable product is the absolute least you can put out that is also a usable product. For your capstone project this means 2 fully functional CRUD features with validation error messages that are unequivocally intuitive and simple to use by someone who has never seen the app before.

Remember, a successful capsone project does not need AWS, Google Maps, Web Sockets or more than 2 CRUD features. But the 2 CRUD features that you do build need to feel and function complete to pass. Essentially, this image says it all both for your capstone project and future projects in your career. If image files could be made out of solid gold, it would be. Keep it in mind always.

# Phase 2 - Project Development

## Daily Standups

Daily standups will take place between groups of 3-5 students from your circle. Each student will take roughly 5 minutes to screen-share their deployed app and code. Specific standup times will always be announced in your circle channel. TA's will ask students a small handful of questions while taking brief notes that are shared with the rest of the module 7 team as well as the PTMs and the Career Quest team.

### Questions for Students:

* When did you last deploy?
* Is all the code you are showing deployed?
* What progress did you make on your goal from yesterday?
* What is your goal for today that you plan to complete before next standup? 
* Does your lead circle TA approve of the goal?
* What is your project status in terms of user stories?

### Other Standup Notes

* If technical questions come up your circle TA will ask you to put them into the lecture questions channel asap as we will not have time to debug during standups.
* TAs will take notes regardless of whether your standup check in seems like it went well or not.
* TA notes will include whether you met yesterdays goal fully / partially / not at all.
* TA notes will also include 3-5 word description of your goal for tomorrow.

## Lecture Questions Emoji System

Because the TA's are asked to answer all questions asynchronously when possible and because capstone issues can often take hours to address the TA's will use slack reaction emojis to communicate the status of your question. Please pay attention to these emojis and consider them official communication. If it seems odd to take emojis seriously welcome to the tech world!


# üëÄ
The eyeballs mean the TA's are aware of the question and are looking into it / discussing it in the Staff Room. There may be other questions ahead of yours and it make take time to resolve the question based on the complexity of the problem and how clear the question was, if screenshots or commits were provided etc.

# ‚úÖ
The green check means that a TA or the student has confirmed that the question has been resolved. If this isn't correct tag one of the TA's in the thread or re-post the question.

# ‚òëÔ∏è
The gray or blue check means the question seems to have been resolved by a TA or other student but is awaiting some form of confirmation.

# ‚ö†Ô∏è or ‚ùå
The alert emoji means the question may not be specific enough or may not show clear evidence of independent student research on AAO, Stack Overflow, Google etc. 

Before the TA's can effectively address the question the student will need to add more information, full-screen screenshots, a description of what you have done so far in terms of research and solution attempts and/or a link to the repo with a recent commit message clearly describing the issue.

Once you have added to the question tag the TAs or re-post a new version of the question in the lecture questions channel.

### Good Question Template

To ensure the quickest possible response to a question you are encouraged to literally copy, paste and fill this out when asking a question in slack. The Mod 7 team may ask you to do so if it seems like it might help expedite answering your question.

1. What are you working on? (give us some context)
2. Describe the problem (what are you trying to do? what is it currently doing?)
3. What error messages do you have?
4. What have you done to debug? What have you searched/tried?
5. Relevant code snippets/screenshots (crop, mark-up, or explain them)

# Phase 3 - Pregrading / Grading

Projects will be pre-graded the Thursday of the second week of capstone development. Our grading process will be identicle to the final grading process and students will recieve pregrading scorecards. There are no requirements associated with pre-grading and it is expected that your project will not yet be passing but it is ideal for you to have your project nearly complete so we can point out minor edits / corrections that will make your project passing the following Monday when projects are due. And if your project passes at pregrading all you'll have to do is not break your site over the weekend!

[Example Scorecard](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ugK44u9KyT_EmPlRiNtsZgCTRY25mVzx2qZo915jo0c/edit?usp=sharing)

Note: you DO NOT have to create your own scorecard, the Mod 7 team will do this for you.
