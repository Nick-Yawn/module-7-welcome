# Module 7 Welcome Pack

Welcome to module 7 and your capstone project! Essentially the final push before the finish line of graduation. This repo holds some links and information that you'll need during the module, especially during the first few days when you'll be proposing your capstone project ideas for approval.

## Module Calendar

This calendar is your primary resource for knowing what you should be working on at any given time and when your deadlines are. Refer to it every day and check it before asking for clarification whenever possible.

## Capstone Project Proposals

You must submit this form and get approval from your lead circle TA before starting any work on your capstone project. Any work you do while waiting for approval may have to be completely re-done based on TA feedback.

[Project Proposal Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc97fVGs_x7CoFOkkdjvhE8lHgwAiHPPkbtf9uTrMYUVNr8kQ/viewform?usp=sf_link)

Don't over-complicate your capstone, this is essentially a 1.5 week project and the stakes are high. The simpler you keep this proposal, the faster it will be approved and the higher the chance will be that you will knock it out of the park and go on successfully into job search. Choose a project that you feel confident that you could build in half the time you're being given. This is the professional move for an engineer under a tight inflexible deadline.

With all that said don't forget to pick something fun if you can. Regardless we're excited to see what you all pick so we can get you approved!

## Projects That Generally Succeed

Here are some clone ideas that tend to be associated with successful student capstone projects from the perspective of the TAs. Some are less work than others, specifically those that can go without AWS and there are definitely more that can be added here, but these ones often correlate with successful and strong looking final projects so keep them in mind. 

* Instagram
* Air BnB
* Yelp
* Quora
* Reddit
* Remember the Milk
* New York Times Recipes
* Evernote
* Robinhood

### Minimul Viable Product (Project)

Remember, a minimum viable product is the absolute least you can put out that is also a usable product. For your capstone project this means 2 fully functional CRUD features with validation error messages that are unequivocally intuitive and simple to use by someone who has never seen the app before.

Remember, a successful capsone project does not need AWS, Google Maps, Web Sockets or more than 2 CRUD features. But the 2 CRUD features that you do build need to feel and function complete to pass. Essentially, this image says it all both for your capstone project and future projects in your career. If image files could be made out of solid gold, it would be. Keep it in mind always.
